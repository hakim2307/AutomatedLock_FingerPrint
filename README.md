# AutomatedLock_FingerPrint is a project that using fingerprint scanner R308 fingerprint module and using a arduino to make automated lock system. Finger print module need to have database to ensure only a few people can use it. To upload database you need SFG Demo 2.0 or upload basic coding for database by using LCD display. After that what you need is a button, relay, door lock motor, and a box to make a safety box using fingerprint. I would upload a coding for you to use.
